@component

The `SidebarMenu` component is part of our Drawer layout and just makes a simple
list of menu links that can be used to navigate throughout the dashboard.

<script>
    // We import any stores we will need to read and/or write
    import { page } from '$app/stores'

    // We are using an array here just to simplify the creation of multiple
    // links that are 99% identical. This technique also makes it easier to
    // modify existing links or add/remove them in the future.

        { route: '/dashboard/send', text: 'Payments' },
